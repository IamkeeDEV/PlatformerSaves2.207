# PlatformerSaves

<img src="./logo.png" alt="PlatformerSaves logo" />

PlatformerSaves is a Geometry Dash mod for [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/) that allows you to save and load your progress in platformer levels.

## Note

This is a fork of "Platformer Saves" by 0x5abe to see if I can port this mod into 2.207 and then I will delete this and do a PR.

## Planned features

- Port PlatformerSaves into 2.207


## Credits

- The Geode team for the amazing tool they've created and inspiring me to make GD mods
- Nikki for help with bindings
- Maromalo for testing and suggestions
- 0x5abe for the original mod "PlatformerSaves"
